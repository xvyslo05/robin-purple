Phone input accepts letters and other characters
- since there is no validation, user is free to set any value he wants to
Steps to reproduce:
  1. go to form
  2. set mandatory fields (first name, email, country, value)
  3. set phoneNumber to some letter value -> for example 'asdf'
  4. submit form

------------------------------------------

firstname and lastname inputs have changed id attributes
 - firstname's id attribute is 'lastname'
 - lastname's id attribute is 'firstname'
