Phone input accepts letters and other characters
- since there is no validation, user is free to set any value he wants to
Steps to reproduce:
  1. go to form
  2. set mandatory fields (first name, email, country, value)
  3. set phoneNumber to some letter value -> for example 'asdf'
  4. submit form

------------------------------------------

firstname and lastname inputs have changed id attributes
 - firstname's id attribute is 'lastname'
 - lastname's id attribute is 'firstname'

------------------------------------------
When sending a form with a country filled, country is not set in the payload
- two optional bugs:
1. country selector does not work properly (you cannot select a country)
2. country is filled wrong, therefore rather no value is sent (most unlikely)

steps to reproduce:
  1. go to form
  2. fill all mandatory data
  3. fill country field with a string "Japan"
  4. submit form
  5. open Network tab and find the submit-form POST request and see the payload
